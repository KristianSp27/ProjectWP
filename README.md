This is a basic WordPress blog with a custom theme and a custom plugin.

I have based the theme on the Lazyfox html theme, by converting it into one suitable for Wordpress.

I have added two plugins:
1. Custom post type plugin
2. Dark mode plugin

I have added a couple of pages with varying functionalities suitable for a blog.
